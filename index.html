<div class="about">
  <p>
    I focus on front end development - which can mean a lot of different things, depending on who and when you ask. On a basic level, I turn designs into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the goal of writing code that is as simple and to the point as possible. Lately, I've also been thinking a lot about clear, concise, and maintainable documentation.

    Aside from code, I'm interested in digital technology and the impact it has on our daily lives, urban planning and the future of cities, how we set, maintain and grow habits and goals, and the relationships we have with money. I've loved the outdoors my entire life and am on a lifetime journey to make my way through the U.S. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1x8aoMb__P09wfHvwynKjZ6nPawg&ll=44.8415769079687%2C-99.58341250000001&z=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Park System</a>.
