I’ve been ~~busy~~, ahem, prioritizing other things lately. I’ve also felt like I’ve been in a bit of a rut, and not in the mood to read and consume. Jocelyn said it best in her [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/jkglei/5kpdgbptbz-998993?e=395624e4a8){:target="_blank"} from the other week:
> But lately, I’ve been a little tapped out on consuming other people’s content. I’m knee-deep in working on two new creative projects, and **it’s hard to hear your own voice if you’re constantly cramming other people’s ideas into your brain**.

I finally felt the urge to put a few links together, so here’s a couple neat things:

1. Loved looking through [these logos](https://kottke.org/18/05/hundreds-of-amazing-1980s-tech-company-logos){:target="_blank"}. Makes me think about all the small tech companies of the past that didn’t “make it” (a la _Halt and Catch Fire_). Also reminds me that its been too long since I stretched my design muscles.

2. Can’t wait for [this](https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work-ebook/dp/B079WV79TK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1527893404&sr=1-1){:target="_blank"} book.

3. [On resistance](https://www.breakthetwitch.com/getting-back-to-happy/){:target="_blank"}.

4. [In praise of extreme moderation](https://hbr.org/2018/06/in-praise-of-extreme-moderation){:target="_blank"}.

    > I long ago decided to invest in extreme moderation. I do everything with the deliberate intent of finding a balance between two extremes — doing nothing and doing too much. I want to do a reasonable job at the different parts of my life and a stellar job at the balance between all of them.

5. [On architecture and automation](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/the-unbearable-awkwardness-of-automation/562670/){:target="_blank"}.
