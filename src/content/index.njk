<h1>Hi, I'm Glenna.</h1>

<p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>

<p>Most recently, I’ve had the opportunity to lead engineering teams in varying industries (deregulated energy, telecommunications, government contracts), each with their own specialized areas of knowledge, unique technical requirements, and product goals. Earlier in my career, I worked at agencies building high quality, award winning digital experiences for local and national clients. Prior to that, you could find me tinkering with front end code and sharpening my graphic design skills.</p>

<p>Today, I value building stable teams with low attrition rates, and coaching managers and individual contributors to reach their full potential. I’ve shaped teams that can meet tight deadlines in fast-paced environments, balancing stability with speed, launching new features to millions of users. I work closely with each team member to help them achieve their career goals, while looking for opportunities to match their goals with those of the team. I build solid, trusting relationships with peers across product, creative, marketing and other engineering teams, helping bring roadmaps to life, and ensuring the successful delivery of high-quality features and products that delight users.</p>
