# 5 Jul 2023

<p>As of early June 2023, I'm taking an intentional break away from full time paid work. I don't really know what I'm doing yet!</p>

<p>I have been focusing on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>figuring out what kind of exercise/movement I enjoy most and doing more of it</li>
	<li>not letting the food from my CSA rot, so, cooking more from scratch</li>
	<li>in late 2023/early 2024 I plan to focus more on traveling, which means I've been using some of my time to plan trips</li>
	<li>practicing writing + sharing my thoughts online</li>
	<li>migrating this site from Jekyll to Eleventy</li>
	<li><a href="/reading/">reading</a></li>
</ul>
